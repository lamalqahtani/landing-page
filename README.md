## Project Description
A pre built static landing page from Udacity Front-End nanodegree program to be converted by students to an interactive landing page using Javascript.

## instructions
The following instruction was provided from udacity to explain the project before starting.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
